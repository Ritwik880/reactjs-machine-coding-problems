## Introduction

Whether you're a beginner looking to solidify your understanding of React or an experienced developer wanting to sharpen your skills, these machine coding problems are tailored to challenge and improve your ReactJS knowledge. Each challenge focuses on a specific aspect of React development, providing you with a practical and fun way to learn.

## Challenges

1. **Challenge 1: [FETCH API](./challenges/challenge01.jsx)**
   - You are provided with a React component named Challenge02. The goal of this challenge is to enhance the existing code to manage and display data       fetched from an API.
   - Utilize the fetchData function to fetch data from the provided API endpoint (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).
   - Display the fetched data in the console using console.log(incomingData).

2. **Challenge 2: [Counter](./challenges/challenge02.jsx)**
   - Create a React component that increments a counter when a button is clicked. 
   - Note: The challenge is to implement it in such a way that it doesn't use the useState hook or class state.

3. **Challenge 3: [Puzzle](./challenges/challenge03.jsx)**
   - Conditional Rendering Puzzle: Build a React component that renders "Hello, World!" initially. After 5 seconds, change the text to "Goodbye, World!" without using any external state management libraries or timers.

4. **Challenge 4: [Form Validation](./challenges/challenge04.jsx)**
   - Create a form with input fields (e.g., name, email, password) and implement client-side form validation. Display error messages if the user enters invalid data.

5. **Challenge 5: [Implement Controlled & UnControlled Components](./challenges/challenge05.jsx)**
   - Implement the controlled component approach for the email input field.
   - Utilize the useRef hook to create an uncontrolled component for the password input field.
   - Log the email and password values to the console during form submission.
   - Ensure that the component renders a form with appropriate input fields and a submit button.
